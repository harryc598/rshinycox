Description: Takes one or more Cox proportional hazards models and writes a
    'shiny' application to a directory specified by the user. The 'shiny' app
    displays predicted survival curves based on user input, and contains none
    of the original data used to create the Cox model or models. The main 
    intention is towards visualization and presentation of predicted survival
    curves.
