\title{Wrapper for \code{survival::coxph()}}
\usage{
make_coxph(formula, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
    a formula object, with the response on the left of a \code{~} operator, and 
    the terms on the right.  The response must be a survival object as 
    returned by the \code{Surv} function.  For a multi-state model the
    formula may be a list of formulas.
  }

\item{data}{
    a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in 
    the \code{formula}, or in the \code{subset} and the \code{weights}
    argument. 
  }

\item{...}{other arguments which will be passed to \code{coxph()}. Note that
\code{x = TRUE} and \code{model = TRUE} are the default arguments, you do not need
to include them here.}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{"coxph"} representing the fit.
}
\description{
Performs \code{\link[survival:coxph]{survival::coxph()}} with \code{model = TRUE} and \code{x = TRUE} as defaults.
Checks that Cox model is appropriate for use with \code{\link[=shine_coxph]{shine_coxph()}}.
}
\examples{
library(survival)
ovarianph <- make_coxph(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ age + strata(rx),
data = ovarian)
